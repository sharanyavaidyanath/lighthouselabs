// Challenge #6 - Turn Out For What
// Phew, with our help the city staff were able to select the voting
//stations on time and the election went off without a hitch!
//Now that the votes have been cast, the Election staff needs to verify
//the votes by matching each voter's signature to their voter ID.

// Instructions
// Complete the function voterTurnout(), that will take in two arrays.
//The first array is a list of voter ids, and the second array is a list
//of voter signatures, which correspond to the voter ids.
//Our task here is to first check that each array have the same number
//of items and then confirm that each of the voter ids matches the
//corresponding voter signature.

// If the arrays do not contain the same number of items,
//then we know something is amiss and our function should return false.
//If they contain the same number of elements, then we should proceed to
//check if the two arrays are identical, meaning they contain the same
//names in the same order. If they are, our function should return
//"All clear, we can count the votes!", if they are not it should return
//"FRAUD!".

const voterTurnout = (voter_signatures, voter_ids) => {
  if (voter_signatures.length === voter_ids.length) {
    for (let i = 0; i < voter_signatures.length; i++) {
      if (voter_signatures[i] !== voter_ids[i]) return "FRAUD!";
    }
    return "All clear, we can count the votes!";
  }
  return false;
};
